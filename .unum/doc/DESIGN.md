## unum - design
This document describes the design for the `unum` systemic platform.  It is
supported by both the work in the manifesto and language documents and should
be considered a _reference implementation_ until otherwise noted.

# Overview
## Vocabulary
* **deployment**: the complete set of hardware and software allocated to an unum
systemic programming architecture

* **basis**: also, _architectural basis_, refers to the sum of shared compute 
resources assigned to an unum deployment.  The basis is first created when the
`unum` base repository is cloned and further maintained during development.

* **kernel**: the platform-specific executable called `unum` which implements
the toolchain and runtime for all systemic operations.

* **bootstrapping**: the process of cloning the `unum` baseline repository 
from VCS (eg. Git) and building its foundation with a local C++ compiler, which
analyzes the platform, captures references to the C++ and linker executables,
and builds the baseline kernel.


## Objectives
1. **Minimal dimensionality**

The platform must primarily support the simplified, holistic development of 
interconnected platforms.  This is accomplished by actively reducing the
cognitive costs of linkage in all forms during an applied development process.

2. **Unmatched performance**

The product of any development, especially in linkage, must far exceed those 
using existing conventional techniques.  The introduction of a systemic, 
distributed compiler must enable unexpected and shocking speed of execution.

3. **Version independence**

Developers must not be beholden to the whims of organizations who build their
platforms and tools to accept the costs of continued upgrades.

4. **Zero cycle time**

The time it takes to deploy a one-line change will deliver instantaneous 
results.

5. **No-friction understanding**

Communicate the highest ideals of systemic programming without introducing 
obstacles to understanding from dependencies, tools, coding style or 
documentation.


## On C++
The choice of C++ for unum is an intentional upgrade over a prior approach
using only C.  The limitations of C, particularly in the areas of modularity 
and encapsulation made it hard to justify its use for what could be a 
significant amount of code to support a massively systemic platform.  While it 
is still a great language and underpins countless projects, it doesn't feel like
a good choice for this scenario, especially when the goal is to move often
between a new language of `unum` and a native language for integration.  It is 
also the choice here to *not* use the standard C++ library at all in this repo, 
instead favoring a coding style and locally-implemented supporting types that 
mirrors the unum code that is transpiled into the C++.  Pursuing the objectives
above and the strategy below motivated a holistic, single mono-repo for as much
behavior as possible, recommending that the significant version differences of 
C++ as a language over the years not influence the architectural decisions here.


## Strategy

* All code for tooling, platform and product for a systemic architecture exists
in a single repository.  External dependencies are only permitted when (a) they
are universally-accepted common runtime components (eg. SQLite), (b) are 
uniquely trusted to implement critical industry-accepted algorithms 
(eg. OpenSSL) or (c) are the only means of integrating with non-unum systems
(eg. PostgreSQL).  This encourages version independence because except for
intentional or minimal  external integrations, everything is the choice of the 
developer who owns a repository.  Not even their toolchain is outside their
control.

* Linkage reliability is systemic, not isolated.  Developers don't encode or
accommodate the uncertainties of distributed communication into their 
software.  This actively destroys the greatest source of dimensionality.

* The systemic language is `unum` but the runtime language is specialized `C++`.
More specifically, `C++` is not used to interpret `unum`, but rather `unum` is
used to write highly-optimal `C++`.  The entire repository assumes C++, not 
machine language is the 'executable'.  This mindset ensures that nearly every 
element of a deployment may be understood and maintained by adopters using 
long-proven technologies.  Those who wish to work entirely in `unum` may do so,
but are not restricted from adapting or extending their deployment as desired.
This actively supports all objectives by standardizing on the fastest, most 
mature, general-purpose programming language available.

* Concepts from programming to tooling to system management adopt a philosophy 
of hierarchical precision.  It is intended that common tasks are very easy and
fully automatic, while more demanding ones may be accomplished by increasing 
the precision of their definition with increasingly descriptive syntax.


## Tactics

* Systemic `unum` products _clone_ a repository and do not _initialize_ it in
a `git`, `npm`, `pip`, etc. manner.  _Cloning is initialization_.

* An unum repository is bootstrapped with a simple makefile and _ingests_ the
C compiler environment exposed by that makefile to use for future deployments.
Makefiles need not be maintained when the developer is not implementing kernel
enhancements (language, basis, analytics, etc).
